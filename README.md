# Project-2-Full-stack-Application

Overview
This second project is my first foray into building a full-stack application. I’ll be building an Express app, which means I’ll be learning about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up myself.

I’ll exercise simple, clean creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before I start, and write a user story to define what my users will want to do with the app.

I need to remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals.
